<p>Captain Star-Glider looked up with three of his eyes as the six glowing masses that formed the Eyes of Bright moved slowly by above him. The polar orbit of his space station carried him close enough to the huge formation that he could see the cylindrical instrument tower sticking out from one end of the spherical main hull of Dragon Slayer. The human spacecraft was as black-cold as a prostitute's eyeball and could only be seen by the red reflections from the Six Eyes and the yellow-white glare from Egg below. He shivered at the thought of living in such a cold place and thankfully spread out his tread on the glowing warmth of the yellow-white deck. It took almost a grethturn before the huge circle of glowing planetoids was far enough off from the vertical that it was no longer &quot;above&quot; him. His three anxious upturned eyes stopped their relentless watch and returned to join the remainder of his twelve eyes in the familiar cheela traveling wave pattern.</p>
<p>The wave pattern quickened as Captain Star-Glider tasted a message scrolling across the communications taste screen built into the deck. They would be launching an exploration ark within a few turns, and the exploration crew had been called for a final briefing. The briefing would take place in two dothturns at the meeting area around on the other side of the space station. The jump loop at Bright's Heaven had been busy the last turn sending up one jumpcraft after another with the crew, while the gravity catapults at the East and West Poles had been busy tossing cargo and equipment into the sky. The catapults were ancient, over eight human hours old. Extremely inefficient, even when aided by the inertia drives on the cargo shuttlecraft, they were slowly being replaced. Most personnel transfers now used the jump loops, and soon nearly everything would come up by way of a space fountain.</p>
<p>Although it really wasn't any of his business, Star-Glider decided to attend the briefing. It wasn't often that an exploration ark was sent off to visit some distant star. In fact, this was going to be the last one for quite a while. The Deep Space Exploration Council had decided for budgetary reasons to limit the number of exploration arks to six. The arks would spend a number of greats of turns at an interesting star, then move on to another one. The rest of the Deep Space Exploration fleet consisted of a small squadron of scout ships and a dozen cargo haulers that resupplied the exploration arks and rotated the crews.</p>
<p>The initial exploration was done by the high-speed scout ships that visited candidate neutron stars looking for interesting stellar dynamics or signs of life. one had recently returned to report that they had found life on a neutron star some 12,000 light-years distant. This was the sixth report of possible life, and the first one where the life forms seems to be intelligent.</p>
<p>Star-Glider had seen the pictures of the aliens when they first appeared on holovid. They were the ugliest things the cheela had seen since humans. The novelty had worn off quickly, however. Star-Glider hadn't heard much about the aliens since and hoped he could learn more at the briefing. He turned the command of the space station over to his first officer, Horizon-Sensor, and made his way along the many centimeters of corridor to the meeting room on the opposite side of his spherically shaped command ship.</p>
<p>When he entered the large, bowl-shaped meeting room, he found it already crowded. Using his undertread to hold onto the slide-stops built into the sloping ramp, he moved down to the high-gravity region near the center of the room. He was nearly a centimeter closer to the miniature black hole at the center of the space station and it felt good to get under a little gravity again, even though it was nowhere near that of the 67 billion gravities of Egg.</p>
<p>Three dozen taste screens were built into the central portion of the meeting room deck. He made his way toward them, his six-pointed captain's badges parting the crowds before him. Normally, his status would have reserved one of the taste screens for him, but since there were 24 scientists and crew members assigned to the exploration ark to be briefed, the four members of the scout ships that had discovered the aliens, and the Deep Space Exploration scientists and managers, he had to content himself with watching one of the intensity-only visual screens built into the low walls of the meeting room. As he settled himself down to wait for the briefing to start, he found he was next to another Space Force captain. Though she was very young-looking to be a captain, she was huge in size, full of vitality, good-looking, and proved to be quick-witted when she switched an eye from the cheela with whom she had been talking. Instantly realizing who he was, she moved her eyes around to his side and lifted her near tread edge to talk.</p>
<p>&quot;Captain Star-Glider?&quot; she said. &quot;I'm Captain Far-Ranger of the interstellar scout ship Triton.&quot; She flicked half her eyes toward her companion. &quot;And this is Lieutenant Star-Finder, our navigator. We both have enjoyed your hospitality these past few turns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I had known you were aboard, Captain, I would have invited you to dinner,&quot; he replied. &quot;Unfortunately, this station is so large that often I don't even know how many spaceshipe we have docked, much less how many visitors are on board. I find your aliens very interesting and would like to learn more about them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are just ugly savages,&quot; Far-Ranger said, &quot;as you will see from the briefing. But they have some real potential if we can set up communication with them. If you are really interested, perhaps we can get together over a meal after the exploration ark leaves. I took a well deserved leave of a half-great of turns when I returned and I still have a few dozen turns to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are my guest, then,&quot; said Star-Glider quickly. &quot;Let's make it at turnfest on Turn 104.&quot; Remembering his manners, he nodded three of his eyes toward Star-Finder. &quot;You are welcome, too, Lieutenant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Captain,&quot; she said. &quot;But I am navigating the exploration ark back to the star. Besides, I am sure you and Captain Far-Ranger will have plenty to talk about.&quot;</p>
<p>Star-Glidder <em>'trummed</em> a polite regret. The briefing had started, and all eyes were focused toward the bottom of the bowl as the strong waves from the tread amplifier at the central speaker's pad rippled through the deck. Star-Glider had to look over the topside of Far-Ranger to see the speaker. A few of his eyes glanced down at her deep red topside, then his gaze wandered to take in her full fleshy eyelids.</p>
<p>One of her near eyes caught him looking at her anatomy. Instead of glaring him down as he expected, the eyes slowly and deliberately dipped down between its eyelids and back out in a long sexy wink. Star-Glider felt his eye-stalks stiffen as he returned his attention to the speaker.</p>
<p>&quot;We will now have a briefing on the alien life forms found on the star by Captain Far-Ranger, Doctor of alienology,&quot; the speaker announced. Star-Glider was impressed when he heard her second title. &quot;You are welcome to use my taste screen,&quot; she said as she started to move through the crowd to the center. He whispered an electronic &quot;Thanks,&quot; then moved onto the glowing patch in the deck where her undertread had been. The taste screen came to life under his tread as her amplified voice boomed out through the deck. </p>
<p>&quot;When we first arrived at NS 1566 + 84, we did a mapping of the entire surface. We found no obvious artifacts, but an artificial intelligence search routine programmed with an alien artifact interest operator drew our attention to one of the magnetic poles.&quot; A picture flashed on the viewscreen showing an enlarged picture of a low chain of mountains with a small cluster of hexagonal markings at the base.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a small village, with individual compounds shaped like clusters of crude hexagons. We were able to get some close-ups with our high resolution scanning array infrared antenna.&quot; An artificial-looking picture showed up on the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;The picture is presented in false colors, since we are looking in the infrared portion of the spectrum instead of the soft X-ray visible portion. The moving objects are blurred by the scanning process, but it is obvious that each compound is inhabited by one or two larger aliens, while the central hexagon in each 'family' grouping contains smaller aliens with an occasional larger one. Outside the compounds are low pens that contain large numbers of very small creatures.</p>
<p>&quot;Once we knew where we could get pictures, we sent in a skimmer orbiter with an X-ray camera and a motion compensator. Despite the mountains nearby, we were able to set the periapsis of the skimmer within less than a meter of the surface ang got some excellent pictures of the aliens.&quot;</p>
<p>A disgusting-looking blob filled the screen. It looked like a Flow Slow in the process of being butchered. The basic body shape was a treadless, eyeless, flattened blob like a Flow Slow, but stripped of its protective plates. Where the plates would have been were ragged sheets of reddish flesh. Into opposite sides of the body, about halfway up, there were stuck long sticklike objects with knobs on the ends. The sticks had a joint at the middle and were slightly bent like the skinny sticklike arms and legs of the humans. From around the place where th stick emerged from the blob, there came a large number of long, wiggly tendrils. The screen flickered, and the image changed slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;We were able to get five successive pictures as the skimmer orbited over this individual, so we can recreate a crude display of motion.&quot; the five pictures were played rapidly on the screen, and the sequence repeated a number of times. The being was rolling along the crust with the knobbed armlike things sticking out to the sides and the tendrils pushing and pulling at the crust to move it along. The ragged flaps of flesh changed colors as they rotated up, over, around, and under the rolling body of the alien.</p>
<p>&quot;You will notice that the sticks become darker the further they are from the body, leaving the knob at the end quite dark red. The knobs are moved backward and forward to cover the regions in front and behind the alien, but they are never used to touch the ground, so they don't seem to be for propulsion. here is a close-up of one of the knobs. It seems to be a sphere with many tiny hexagonal facets. We believe the knobs are their eyes. They seem to be similar in structure to the eyes of bees or flies on the human planet Earth. The stick must be a special bonelike material with high strength but low heat conduction to keep the eyes cool.&quot;</p>
<p>There were a number of other pictures, including a unique one showing two of the aliens side-by-side, grasping each other with their tendrils, their eye-sticks seemingly buried in each other's body.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not positive what is going on here,&quot; said Far-Ranger. &quot;However, if you are thinking what I think you are thinking, you are probably right.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a rumble in the deck, and someone remarked through the laughter, &quot;I guess if you do it with only one eye at a time, you get more deeply involved...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The most amazing feature of this alien culture is that there is no plant life. All the creatures seem to be animals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what is the base of the food chain?&quot; someone asked.</p>
<p>&quot;It took a long time for us to find out, but one of the clues is that there are only two regions where life is found. They are the two magnetic poles. I can't call them the East and West Poles as we do here on Egg, because they are quite close to the spin poles. The star has a lot of material left around it from the original supernova explosion, and there is a constant infall of expanded, neutron-poor, planetary-type material at each pole. In fact, there is so much that I didn't dare risk our scout-ship in flights over those polar regions. The mountain passes are fully of tiny eyeless ball-like animals that probably absorb this neutron-poor dust from the surface of the crust and extract energy to live and grow from the process of converting it into normal crustal material. The larger balls are selected out by the intelligent aliens and herded into pens until they are eaten for food. The aliens are evidently still in the hunting-gathering stage of savagery, except that with no plant life, huting and gathering are synonymous.&quot;</p>
<p>Another picture flashed on the screen. It was the carcass of one of the aliens, surrounded by hundreds of tiny carcasses. All had obviously been seared by a super-hot flash of hard gamma rays from the infall of a large chunk of matter onto the star. &quot;It seemed that being the one chosen to herd in the food supply can be dangerous. I think that one of the ways we can help these aliens is to keep a watch on the larger incoming chunks and warn them away from the mountains during the time they are falling. That should cut their gathering losses. Also, we might be able to stabilize the amount of infall so they have a constant supply of food. Once we have secured their food supply, then maybe they will have the leisure time to talk to us and develop their culture.&quot;</p>
<p>Three turns later, it was time for the expedition to leave. Star-Glider and Far-Ranger said goodbye to Lieutenant Star-Finder, then watched as the interstellar exploration ark, Amalita Shakhashiri Drake, pulled a few meters away for safety. they couldn't feel the humming as the spinor warp as the space between Dragon's Egg and a point some 100 light-years away was nullified. A large red marker star zoomed in from the distance, so close they could see the cloudy patches on it. Then the spinor drive reinserted the nullified space, but this time on the other side of the ark. The Amalita and the red star zoomed back into the heavens together.</p>
<p>&quot;A hundred light-years in the time it takes to move a single tread length,&quot; said Star-Glider.</p>
<p>&quot;All you need to do is shrink the hundred light-years until it is but a tread-length long,&quot; Far-Ranger said. &quot;Bright's Oath, my pouch is dry. How about some juice before turnfeast?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good idea,&quot; Star-Glider said. &quot;I have a few bags of West Pole Double-Distilled in my locker at my quarters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great!&quot; she said, her nearest eye giving him a long, slow, wink. &quot;You spread the field lines and I'll follow along behind&quot;</p>
<p>He lead the way to his cabin, the moving bulk of his conducting body spreading the weak magnetic field lines stringing through the space-station plates. They were nowhere near as strong as the trillion-gauss fields on Egg so there was no need for him to act as pathbreaker, but he didn't mind having her snuggled up to his trailing edge. As they moved down the roofless corridor, a few of his eyes looked up into the sky to watch the formation of six asteroids pass over once again. Around each glowing mass were tiny specks that glared periodically. They were the herder rockets that kept the condensed asteroids in their proper position around Dragon Slayer. If these ever failed, the humans would be torn apart by the ferocious tides of Egg. He suddenly stopped and all his eyes turned upward.</p>
<p>&quot;What is the matter?&quot; Far-Ranger asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The pattern is wrong,&quot; Star-Glider replied. &quot;The pulses are coming at the wrong times. Something has happened to the Eyes of Bright!&quot; For a blink he panicked at the thought of those large objects falling <em>down</em> on him. Then reason reminded him they were in orbit. They wouldn't fall, but something was definitely wrong. He flowed around Far-Ranger and headed back up the corridor to the command deck at full tread-ripple.</p>
<p>&quot;The humans are in trouble!&quot; he said. &quot;Follow me!&quot;</p>
