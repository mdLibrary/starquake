<p>&quot;That's the last of the HoloMem storage crystals, Pierre,&quot; Jean said as she turned away from the communications console. &quot;Most of the material on that one was encrypted. I hope they have the crypto-keys.&quot; She swiveled back as the image of Sky-Speaker flashed on the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;Keys obvious,&quot; said Sky-Speaker. &quot;Goodbye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I liked the old Sky-Teacher better,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;He talked so verbosely that it gave you time to think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have plenty of time to think now,&quot; Jean said quietly as she shut down the communications console. She reached under the counter and extracted the HoloMem crystal that had come from the library and replaced it with the regular console crystal that kept a log of everything that went through the console.</p>
<p>&quot;Too much time,&quot; said Pierre. He followed Jean as she ottered her way down the passageway to the crew deck. Jean went to the library console and restored the HoloMem to its place in the storage rack. Pierre, driven by his command responsibility, returned to the galley and stared at the listing of the food supplies on the food storage lockers. There was food for eight more days at normal rations, sixteen days at half-rations, thirty-two days at quarter-rations...only one month. It would take five more months after that before Oscar returned from its long elliptical orbit around Egg. His eyes didn't look at the bank of lockers with the blank label. Bouncing lightly in the low gravity, he passed Jean at the library console and turned into the lounge. Doc was talking with Seiko and Abdul was looking pensively out of the viewport in the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;HoloMems done?&quot; asked Abdul, looking up.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep,&quot; said Pierre, floating lightly to the cushion beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything left for us mere humans to do?&quot; Abdul asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The cheela don't need us anymore. They should be well on their way to recovery by now.&quot; A tiny white-hot speck appeared outside the viewport window and stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Smile,&quot; said Abdul. &quot;You're about to have your picture taken by some tourists.&quot;</p>
<p>The speck released a shower of sparks. There was a flickering of light, then the sparks rejoined the glowing speck and it sped away.</p>
<p>&quot;What are your plans for the rest of the mission, Pierre?&quot; Seiko asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no plans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must!&quot; Seiko sounded disturbed. &quot;We must not waste our lives doing nothing until we die!&quot;</p>
<p>Pierre raised his gaze from the viewport. The anguish in his face showed through the ragged, unkempt beard.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't find a way to save us,&quot; he said, tears starting to well up in his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you can't,&quot; said Seiko. &quot;There <em>is</em> no way to save us. It is simple mathematics. There are five people to feed and only eight days of food rations. We might be able to stretch that out using our body reserves, but we will be out of food in a month. We could even consider eating Amalita's body. At best, we could only get about 50 kilos of meat from it.&quot; She turned to Doc Wong.</p>
<p>&quot;How many calories in meat, Doctor Wong?&quot; she asked him.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe this conversation!&quot; said Abdul. &quot;There is no way I'm going to be a cannibal! I'm leaving!&quot; He started to dive out the door to his private quarters, but Pierre held him back with a hand on one shoulder. He kept it there as he nodded at Doc to answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Use the values for pork, Doc,&quot; Abdul blurted. &quot;I hear from my cannibal friends that you can't tell the difference.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most meats have about 4000 calories per kilogram,&quot; said Dr. Cesar Wong. &quot;The average person could live on a half-kilo of meat per day if the diet were supplemented with vitamins.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So 50 kilos would only last us 20 days at full rations or 80 days at quarter rations,&quot; said Seiko. &quot;We are still short by two months.&quot; She paused for a second. &quot;As I said, there is no way to save us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought for sure that the next thing you were going to suggest was that we draw straws,&quot; said Abdul to Pierre.</p>
<p>&quot;Abdul!&quot; Pierre said severely.</p>
<p>&quot;I have calculated that option,&quot; said Seiko. &quot;There is a problem. If we wait for a person to die of hunger, then there is very little nourishment left on the body.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There'll be none left on mine!&quot; said Abdul.</p>
<p>&quot;If, however, a person dies at the beginning of the period, then not only does his body become a source of significant nourishment, but he is not consuming food as time goes on. Using Doctor Wong's calorie estimate, while two carcasses would allow quarter rations for four people over the same period, three could supply adequate nourishment for the remaining three for six months.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great!&quot; cried Abdul. &quot;Why stop at cannibalism when we can have ritualistic murder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Although such an option is technically feasible,&quot; continued Seiko, &quot;I personally have no intention of suggesting or participating in any such option.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; Abdul asked. &quot;Afraid of drawing the short straw?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. The long one,&quot; answered Seiko. &quot;Neither you, nor I, nor any of the others, could return to our respective cultures if we had to survive using that solution. I, for one, am going to spend my last days completing my scientific studies, preparing my work for publication, and transmitting it back to St. George. It will be the culmination of my career. When I am done, I am ready to go.&quot; She turned to Dr. Wong again.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have termination capsules on board, Doctor Wong?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Cesar replied.</p>
<p>Seiko then turned back to Pierre. &quot;It will be difficult to stay rational as time goes on,&quot; she said matter-of-factly. &quot;I would recommend that you consider consigning Amalita's body to space now. That way we can avoid temptation later.&quot; She dove out the door and pulled herself up through the passageway to the Science Deck.</p>
<p>Pierre looked around at the others.</p>
<p>&quot;She's right,&quot; Jean said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll help take her out,&quot; said Cesar.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't mind, I'd rather be somewhere else,&quot; said Abdul. &quot;I don't think I could take it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Doc and I can handle it, and Jean can run the EVA controls for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Amalita had been placed in the storage locker in a fetal position, so she was relatively easy to move around on the deck, but it was a close fit through the passageway holes. She was still in her spacesuit, since Doctor Wong had not bothered to examine her further after he had removed her helmet and found the broken neck. Seiko closed down the star physics console and dimmed the star image table as they brought Amalita to the Science Deck.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll hold Amalita while you get your suits on,&quot; she said softly, taking the frosty burden from them.</p>
<p>&quot;The EVA lock is ready,&quot; said Jean. She got up from the EVA console, helped Pierre and Cesar with their suits, and took them through the checkout sheet, trying to be as careful and thorough as Amalita had always been.</p>
<p>&quot;Magni-stiction boots...&quot; said Jean. Pierre flicked a switch in his chest console that rearranged the pseudorandom pattern of the magnetic monopoles in the soles of his boots so they matched up with the hexagonal pattern of monopoles built into the inner plates and hull of Dragon Slayer. His boots clanged onto the deck, twisted outward at a 30-degree angle.</p>
<p>&quot;Check,&quot; he said, then clumped into the EVA lock. He turned around and helped Cesar maneuver Amalita's body in through the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget your safety lines,&quot; said Jean. &quot;There are some weird gravity fields out there.&quot; Pierre attached a line to himself and another to the ring in Amalita's suit. Just then a dark head appeared in the passageway hole in the deck.</p>
<p>&quot;I had to say goodbye,&quot; said Abdul. He forced himself to look at Amalita's badly burned face. His left hand reached into the singed hair and held it lightly, while his right hand took two kisses from his lips and placed them softly on the frosted blisters of Amalita's closed eyelids. He turned and dove down the passageway, leaving behind clusters of teardrops moving upward in the swirling air.</p>
<p>Jean cycled them through.</p>
<p>&quot;The best place to release her is near the viewport window,&quot; Pierre said as he climbed out the outer lock. He carefully attached his magni-stiction boots to the hull, then shifted his safety line to a tiedown. &quot;She'll be pulled outward to the ring of compensator masses and be gone in a flash of plasma. The last thing we want is to have her, or 'pieces' of her, in orbit.&quot;</p>
<p>They moved carefully over the hull to a point near the viewport. They were standing at the south pole of their little moon that circled around the neutron star five times a second. The hull of Dragon Slayer did not spin while it orbited, however, but stayed oriented with respect to the distant stars. To the two humans standing on the hull, the white-hot neutron star seemed to be rotating around the equator of the ship five times a second, while above and below them whirled a ring of six red masses that passed over the two poles of the spherical ship while it rotated to always be tangent to the direction to the star. In this configuration, the gravity tides from the ring of masses cancelled the dangerous gravity tides from the star and allowed the humans to survive.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll give her a slight push while you pay out the safety line,&quot; Pierre said.</p>
<p>He let go of Amalita's body, and the uncompensated tides started to pull her outwards. The further she got away from the ship and the closer she got to the massive bodies in the ring, the stronger the forces became. A sprinkling of white-hot sparks gathered off in the distance to observe.</p>
<p>&quot;She is getting heavy,&quot; said Cesar.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks stable,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Let her go.&quot;</p>
<p>The last of the safety rope whipped through the tiedown and followed Amalita as she accelerated rapidly toward the ring 200 meters away. Just before she reached the ring her body was momentarily surrounded by a swirling cloud of white-hot specks. There was a flash, and she was gone.</p>
<p>When Pierre and Cesar came inside, Jean and Seiko helped them out of their suits.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless somebody is going to use the console library, I think I'll get back to working on my book,&quot; said Pierre.</p>
<p>&quot;Which one?&quot; Jean asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The popular version that covers everything that happened on the trip. I was going to call it <em>Dragon's Egg,</em> but the editors at Ballantine Interplanetary said that they already had a title of that name in their inventory. Besides, they wanted something more personal, so they chose, <em>My Visit With Our Nucleonic Friends.</em> I think it's a dumb title, but they are the ones buying the book.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think money is a consideration anymore,&quot; Seiko reminded him.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Pierre glanced down at the star image table and noticed that there were a number of new features on the surface of the neutron star.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been some changes in the last hour,&quot; he said to Seiko.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied. &quot;While you and Doctor Wong were outside, the cheela have reestablished a highly technological civilization on the ground and have resumed extensive space travel activities. They have rapidly caught up to where they were at the time of the starquake and are continuing on at a rapid pace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd better get busy writing if I am going to stay up with them.&quot; Pierre reached down and pulled himself through the passageway hole in the deck. He stopped when he came to the main deck. Abdul was there. He had opened the metal shield on one of the equatorial viewports and was looking out through the tinted glass.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! Look at the sightseers,&quot; Abdul hollered across the deck. &quot;It's like being one of the heads on Mount Rushmore. Why don't you come over and pretend to be Teddy Roosevelt? You've got the beard for it.&quot; As Pierre approached the window, the number of specks outside increased dramatically.</p>
