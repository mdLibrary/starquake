<p>Captain Star-Glider was waiting at the docking port as the small jumpcraft maneuvered closer to the space station. It was carrying a two-star admiral, and custom demanded that the captain of the station be there to greet such an important visitor. He wasn't sure why the admiral was coming. It might be that he was on his way out into space, but Star-Glider was not aware of any imminent deep space launches. He suspected that the visit might involve him, since his tour of duty as station commander was about over and it was time for him to move on to a new command. While he waited, he allowed four of his eyes to watch the Six Eyes of Bright pass over, only a kilometer away. It was now over four greats of turns since the meteorite had struck the rocket and the compensator masses were now noticeably out of line. He idly wondered what the bureaucracy of the Combined Clans was doing about it for he had heard nothing in the holovid news reports.</p>
<p>The jumpcraft docked smartly on a flat spot on the side of the spherical space station.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to the Polar Orbiting Space Station, Admiral Milky-Way,&quot; Star-Glider said, his tendrils brushing his six-pointed captain's star in salute. &quot;What brings you so far from the warmth of Egg?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I <em>could</em> say that I've come on a surprise inspection,&quot; the admiral answered. Then his tread rippled with laughter as he noticed the nervous twitch in Star-Glider's eye-stubs. &quot;But actually I've come to see you about a private matter. Can we retire to your quarters?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot; Star-Glider was slightly puzzled. Usually a change of command was made by a public announcement. He led the way down the corridors and they entered his quarters. He had left the holovid on and the viewblock contained a close-up of a single cheela eye. It was a cool, deep red and the eye-stub below it was thickening as it drew the eye down below the plumpest, sexiest eyeflap on Egg. The holocamera pulled back to show the rest of the female cheela as she conturned her slow ripple across the stage, winking one eye after another as she sang the slightly risque song, 'Twine Thine Eyen About Mine.&quot; Slightly embarrassed, Star-Glider moved over to the control patch to turn it off, but the admiral blocked his way with a tendril.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't do that,&quot; he said. &quot;Let her finish her song, it's one of my favorites.&quot; He moved over to a resting pad and flowed himself out to enjoy the show. Star-Glider perched on the other pad with half his eyes on the viewblock and half on the admiral. The song came to an end, and with it the show. Star-Glider moved out a portion of his tread and turned off the holovid.</p>
<p>&quot;A perfectly delightful creature, that Qui-Qui,&quot; Milky-Way rumbled. &quot;I find her an excellent antidote for egg-tending fever. Every time I see those twelve luscious eyeflaps, I feel like a hatchling again.&quot; He shuffled his tread a bit, then reached into a pouch and pulled out a message scroll. Instead of rolling it over to Star-Glider, he held onto it as he talked.</p>
<p>&quot;As you probably realize, your tour of duty here is coming to an end. You have done an excellent job and could stay on here for another tour if you so desire, but you have been recommended for another position. It is not one of the normal command posts, but is a unique one-time mission that requires someone with your breadth of experience in large space operations. It will be an onerous post at times and will require a long-term commitment on your part. Longer than the usual four-great tour of duty. For those reasons, we are not just going to assign you to the post. Instead, I came up here to talk to you candidly about the positive and negative aspects of the position and give you an opportunity to turn it down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mind committing myself to an extra-long duty tour, if it is the right kind of post,&quot; said Star-Glider. &quot;But what is so onerous about the job?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will be given full responsibility ... but almost no authority,&quot; Milky-Way explained. &quot;In fact, most of the work of the commander of this special mission will be to beg and plead and cajole to get enough authority to carry out the mission he has the responsibility to perform. In this case, by authority I mean money.&quot; He rolled the message scroll across the deck.</p>
<p>&quot;It was over four greats of turns ago that a meteorite struck one of the rockets herding the Six Eyes of Bright and placed the humans in danger. At that time it was estimated that it would take about five human minutes or ten greats of turns before the circular formation of the Six Eyes became so deformed that the gravity tides would tear the Inner Eye spaceship apart. Shortly after that, even the isolation tanks would be unable to protect the humans.</p>
<p>&quot;When the accident happened, the President of the Combined Clans made the commitment that the people of Egg would undertake a mission to restore the rocket and save the humans. But the initial public enthusiasm for the project rapidly wore off. It was a full two greats of turns before even a design study contract was issued—and <em>it</em> was inadequately funded. The Web Construction Company has completed the design effort and come up with a technically feasible approach. They tried to keep the costs down, but the mission is going to require a significant increase in the space budget and the Legislature of the Combined Clans are clenching their treads and procrastinating to avoid having to appropriate the funds.&quot;</p>
<p>Star-Glider pushed on the scroll and it flattened out on the deck. He lowered an eye to read it.</p>
<p>&quot;A promotion to admiral!&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Six more points on your star if you take the job,&quot; said Milky-Way. &quot;And I can almost guarantee another star if you can ride the Swift without getting eaten.&quot;</p>
<p>Star-Glider hesitated.</p>
<p>&quot;You will earn every one of those six points if you take the job,&quot; said the admiral. &quot;You will have to go on holovid shows and attend clan gatherings to regenerate public enthusiasm for the project. You will have to get to know most of the members of the Legislature of the Combined Clans and become so close to the members of the legislative sub-group on Space, Communications, and Slow One Interactions that they will think of you as a hatchling mate. Above all, despite provocation, you will have to keep calm, make no enemies, and never lose your temper. Can you do it? <em>Will</em> you do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Star-Glider responded emphatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Congratulations ... Admiral,&quot; said Milky-Way. &quot;I happen to have brought along some dozen-pointers with me.&quot; He fumbled through his pouches, then pulled out a board with a half-dozen stars on it. While Star-Glider remained motionless in the middle of the room, the admiral circled him, pulling six-pointed stars out of the holding sphincters in Star-Glider's body and inserting shiny new twelve-pointed stars. When he completed the circuit he asked, &quot;Care to change your name, too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I still like the one I chose after I graduated from the academy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well then, Admiral Star-Glider,&quot; said Milky-Way. &quot;Let's assemble your crew for an announcement.&quot;</p>
<p>Admiral Star-Glider turned over the command of the space station to First Officer Horizon-Sensor and returned with Milky-Way to the surface of Egg. He had been in orbit for over a great of turns and was looking forward to going to his clan gatherings again.</p>
<p>The pilot on the jumpcraft used a short burst of inertia drive to drop them out of their polar orbit. He timed the deorbit push so that their perigee occurred near the East Pole. As they approached the strong magnetic field region above the pole, stubby superconducting wings unfolded from the slender jumpcraft. Tilting the winged spacecraft as it flew through the slippery magnetic field lines, the pilot transferred momentum to Egg through the East Pole fields and switched from a polar orbit to an equatorial orbit. There was no change in the jumpcraft's speed since the interaction with the magnetic field was essentially lossless. The maneuver took them within a hundred meters of the thin metal stalk of the Space Fountain. The tower was now fifty kilometers high and loomed above their trajectory. Star-Glider made sure he was on the topside as the turn was made. The view was excellent. He could even see the small construction elevators moving up and down the lengthening shaft.</p>
