<p>When the Rescue Expedition returned from its successful mission, the Commander of the East Pole Space Station arranged a formal reception for Admiral Star-Glider and his staff. Admiral Milky-Way and a number of the sextant leaders from the Legislature jumped up for the occasion.</p>
<p>Cliff-Web dutifully shined up his engineer badges, painted his body in a pattern of silver and yellow that Moving-Sand had assured him was stylish, plugged his remaining holding sphincters with glow-jewels, and suffered through the event.</p>
<p>The reception started at turnfeast and lasted three dothturns. The foodmats were covered with enough food and drink to gorge a Flow Slow. There was a whole roasted hatchling with its pouches full of triposter-nut stuffing and tastefully garnished to cover the accident scar, cubes of Flow Slow marinated in a pungent sauce that Cliff-Web didn't care for, a chopped fruit he hadn't seen before, topped with pickled Tiny Shell eggs, and baskets piled high with tiny bags of sparkling juice from White Rock City. Cliff-Web took two and broke one in his eating pouch. The delicate flavor of the distilled pulp juice was heightened by the spurts of energy from the fissioning uranium nuclei added just before the distillate was bagged. Cliff-Web stayed until Admiral Milky-Way climaxed the event by a promotion ceremony for Admiral Star-Glider. Three sextant leaders and three Space Force officers formed a circle around Star-Glider and each replaced a single twelve-pointed star with a two star cluster. Star-Glider took the opportunity to choose a new name for himself. He was now Admiral Steel-Slicer.</p>
<p>Cliff-Web decided it was time to leave when Schuler-Period started making eyes at him. She was at least two pulp-bags past her limit and was trying to get him to come to her quarters to sample her locker. She wasn't bad looking and would have been fun to tread, but he made it a point never to get involved with government officials. He did too much business with the government. He slipped away while she was admiring Steel-Slicer's new stars.</p>
<p>A dothturn later, stripped of his reception finery, he was at the launch deck of the space station, waiting for a Web Construction Company shuttlecraft to pick him up. The launch deck was on the Egg-facing side of the spherical space station. He looked out at his glowing home world and tried to make out the cities below. At 406 kilometers distance the cities were blurred patches on the yellow crust, and the only thing that showed up was the cool patch of the East Pole mountain range with his Space Fountain rising up from it.</p>
<p>The top of the Space Fountain stopped at 405,900 meters, while the East Pole Space Station was in synchronous orbit at 406,300 meters. The space station was located slightly to one side of the Space Fountain so he could not only see the nucleus of what was to be the Topside Platform, but the long stalk that held it up over the East Pole mountains. As he watched, a glowing dot rose from the platform below him. It started to drift off to the west, but thrusters brought it back under the space station. The speck grew larger, turned into a Web Construction shuttlecraft, and settled on the launch deck. Cliff-Web recognized the pilot as Heavy-Egg, one of the shift supervisors for the Topside Platform crew. With the two stations this close together, it didn't require a trained space pilot to move from one to the other. Just another example of how the Space Fountain was going to revolutionize space travel on Egg.</p>
<p>Cliff-Web moved along the curved ramp that allowed his body to transition from the gravity field of the black hole in the center of the space station to the field of the tiny black hole in the center of the four-cheela shuttiecraft.</p>
<p>&quot;How is the job going, Heavy-Egg?&quot; Cliff-Web asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Like a greased Swift, Boss,&quot; Heavy-Egg replied, lifting the shuttlecraft vertically out of its dimple in the launch ramp area. &quot;We're way ahead of schedule. We stopped 100 meters short of top-out three turns ago. I've got the crew making Topside Platform look decent for the topout ceremony. The Chief Engineer says there's going to be a bunch of big badges from Bright's Heaven and the Space Force coming for it.&quot;</p>
<p>Cliff-Web was not looking forward to another formal reception, especially one he would be paying for; but it was all part of doing business. They berthed in a hemispherical cradle near the middle of a 50-millimeter flat disk covered with busy workers engaged in the long task of expanding the disk into a large, 200-millimeter diameter platform that would have low walls to divide the deck into offices and compounds for the operations crew, and shops and eating places for the passengers and tourists. This was the top of the three decks in Topside Platform where the passengers and cargo would be transferred from the Fountain to various space stations and spacecraft and back again.</p>
<p>Cliff-Web and Heavy-Egg glided off the spherical shuttlecraft onto the flat deck.</p>
<p>&quot;It sure feels good being on a flat surface again after all that time in space on curved decks,&quot; Cliff-Web remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Heavy-Egg agreed. &quot;I never did trust them black holes. I like to be under Egg gravity, even if it is kind of weak.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;During top-out just make sure you stop your crew after 100 meters,&quot; said Cliff-Web. &quot;The gravity from Egg will still be strong enough to keep us together. But if you go 300 meters more, the gravity will drop to zero...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And <em>whoosh!</em> We get as big as humans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Become a cloud of plasma, is more like it,&quot; said Cliff-Web. &quot;Things are progressing well here on Topside, let's take the elevators to the middle deck.&quot;</p>
<p>They went to a special freight elevator reserved for the operations personnel. The tread pad in front of the elevator door recognized Heavy-Egg's tread and let them board. They stopped at the middle deck and moved off into a cavernous room. The deck beneath their tread vibrated with energy. The bottom of the deck above was not cooled to simulate sky, but was only covered with silver paint. It helped some, but even though he was an experienced engineer, having something overhead still bothered Cliff-Web.</p>
<p>There was a loud clang from nearby.</p>
<p>&quot;Still getting pushouts?&quot; Cliff-Web asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Three or four per turn,&quot; Heavy-Egg answered. 'The Chief Engineer makes us save them and send them to Quality. An up-deflector on platform 200 caused some trouble, but that got fixed. Now Quality says we are just weeding out bad rings.&quot;</p>
<p>They moved over to a massive tube that rose out of the deck, curved into a large arc that touched the ceiling overhead, then came back down to penetrate the deck again. Six of them were equally spaced around the center of the deck. In a bin near the tube was a glowing-hot ring suspended in a magnetic field. A young roustabout was fishing out the ring with a hook. As soon as the ring was placed on the deck, she sucked her manipulator inside her body to cool it off.</p>
<p>&quot;Bright's Turd!&quot; she swore. &quot;That eye-ball-sucking catcher field is <em>hot!&quot;</em></p>
<p>She hadn't sensed their approach on the noisy deck, but now saw them coming with one of her eyes. She didn't know who the stranger was, but from all the metal hanging off him, he must be some sort of big badge. She pulled her still stinging manipulator out and picked up the ring.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll get this right over to Quality, Supervisor,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a blink, youngling,&quot; said Cliff-Web. &quot;I want to feel it.&quot; The young roustabout looked at her supervisor, who flicked his eyes at the deck. She put the ring down and the big badge flowed over it.</p>
<p>The ring was large, half the diameter of a cheela. Made of highly polished monopole-stabilized superconducting metal, it was a precision part in a precision machine. The ring was subject to terrific accelerations as it was thrown upward at nearly half the speed of light. Any flaw in the polished surface could cause local heating and the possibility of the loss of superconductivity.</p>
<p>&quot;No dents, but there is a hot spot on the outside and a tiny stress crack,&quot; said Cliff-Web. He flowed off the ring and the youngling picked it up and took it off. Cliff-Web then moved over to the side of the up-pipe and peered through a view port in the side. Illuminated by the glowing metal of the room-temperature pipe, the procession of cold silvery rings blended into a seemingly solid bar that waved slowly back and forth to show that it was a moving stream. The rings had started at nearly half light-speed at the surface, but as they drifted upward, they lost speed from the intense pull of Egg and the tiny tugs at each deflector platform. They were still going at one-twelfth light-speed when they reached Topside Platform.</p>
<p>Cliff-Web peered upward where he could see the black nothingness of the cold bending magnet that turned the rings around and sent them back down again. Cliff-Web watched the stream carefully for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Very steady flow,&quot; he finally said. &quot;Every acceleration bucket must have a ring in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At last break-turn in Swift's Climb, the Base Plant Supervisor bragged they were at three elevens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The entire crew is doing an excellent job,&quot; Cliff-Web remarked. &quot;I'd like to ride it down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We got some spare lifts,&quot; said Heavy-Egg. &quot;I'll get one set up. I'm almost at break-turn, so I'll take you down.&quot;</p>
<p>They took the elevator to the bottom deck. This would be the transfer point for passengers, so the ceiling was cold black with simulated stars. The lifts on the Space Fountain rode the streams up to this deck, while the streams of rings continued on to the turning magnets above them on the middle deck. The passengers and freight transferred to smaller elevators that took them to the top deck, while the lifts were detached from the streams, pulled back from the hole in the platform and stacked until a down-going lift was needed.</p>
<p>As Cliff-Web watched, a lift was removed from a stack, placed on glide-rails and moved out on support arms until its deflection coils surrounded the tubes carrying the flowing streams. Each lift used three stream pairs for safety. The support arms were pulled back, and the lift bounced lightly as it shifted its load to the streams. A roustabout hurried over with a ramp to cover the crack between the platform and lift. Cliff-Web waved him back with a flip of his eye-stubs.</p>
<p>&quot;Save it for the crust-crawlers,&quot; he said, gliding over the six-micron-wide crack. He tried to keep his eyes focused off in the distance, but some of them insisted on looking down at Egg, 406 kilometers below his tread.</p>
<p><em>The things a boss must do to maintain respect,</em> he said to himself.</p>
<p>Heavy-Egg activated the lift controls. As soon as they cleared the bottom deck, the pipe covering the ring stream ended, and they could see the reflection of Egg's glowing crust in the silvery flow. Except for the first 100 millimeters, where a vacuum pipe was needed to keep the weak electron and iron vapor atmosphere of Egg from heating the rings, there was no solid structure in the tower, not even a skeleton framework, just flowing rings.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't mind, Boss, I got a few chores to do while I take you down,&quot; Heavy-Egg said.</p>
<p>&quot;The job comes first. It would be different if I were a paying passenger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got to finish the checkout on this lift and later on down deliver a part to Platform 40.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of checkout?' Cliff-Web asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The stream selector controls,&quot; Heavy-Egg replied. &quot;Right now we ride on all six streams. Drag on the up-streams and push on the down-streams. I just got to check that we can turn off a coupler if a stream gets rough and the automatic doesn't do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Cliff-Web wasn't worried. He knew this part of the design well. The lift could theoretically levitate on just one stream, although, if it were badly unbalanced, the torque rebalance requirement could cause problems at the next deflector platform. Two or three streams were more than adequate for a smooth ride. He watched with interest as Heavy-Egg turned off one coupler after another and checked the response of the other five couplers as they took up the load. Then Heavy-Egg turned off all three down couplers and rode only on the up-streams. He reversed the controls and they switched to riding the downstreams only without a noticeable glitch in the motion.</p>
<p>&quot;No problems there,&quot; said Heavy-Egg. &quot;We're coming up on Platform 40.&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing the decimal number for the platform at 40 kilometers altitude made Cliff-Web's eye-stubs twitch. <em>Every</em> engineering measurement on Egg used the base twelve numbering system <em>except</em> distance. They had inherited meters, kilometers, and millimeters from the humans and seemed to be stuck with it despite many attempts to switch to a non-metric length system where the units were in easily calculated multiples of twelve.</p>
<p>Heavy-Egg brought the lift to a smooth stop. A small crew was busy repairing a redundant deflector on stream four-up. Cliff-Web glided over to the edge of the platform. The gravity acceleration on the platform was now significantly stronger, about one sixteenth that on the surface of Egg. He looked out over the barrier. At 40 kilometers altitude he could make out the outline of Swift's Climb and see the kilometer-long streak of the Jump Loop on the east side which he would shortly be using for the jump home. He hadn't heard anything from Moving-Sand, so Lassie was still alive, but he wondered if she was still mentally alert enough to remember him.</p>
<p>It was nearly turnfeast when Cliff-Web returned to his compound. As the front door slid into its recess he was engulfed with a swarrn of happy snuffling Slinks. Even Lassie was there, having dragged herself from the mat next to the oven as soon as she had heard his familiar scuffle as he came up the street. Lassie's cluster had grown with the addition of a clutch of hatchlings. They had never seen Cliff-Web before, but that didn't stop them from joining the happy throng, leaking from both intake and output orifices in their hatchling eagerness. He twirled them all around the eye-rims again and again, until, finally satisfied, they rumbled off. Rollo must have forgotten him, because he was back hiding behind Slurge, which was just managing to push its way through the magnetic fence that bordered the tasty patch of parasol plants. Cliff-Web flowed over to the miniature Flow Slow, and, forming a large bony manipulator, gave Slurge a hard rap on the armored plate just below one of its tiny eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Back on the lawn!&quot; he hollered.</p>
<p>Slurge retracted its eyes from the side toward the parasol patch. Without the constant reminder of the tasty plants coming to its almost nonexistent brain-clump, it quickly forgot about the garden and started back in the other direction onto the lawn, where it continued its methodical munching and sucking. With the Flow Slow moving in the proper direction, Cliff-Web had time to look at the arrangement of his garden. Moving-Sand must have had some success breeding the fountain plants, for there was a tall one in the center of the circular patch with six more arranged in a hexagon around the central one. All seven were sending up healthy showers of sparks. He then finally noticed something odd. If he had not just come from the East Pole he would have noticed it earlier. All the showers of sparks were going straight up into the air. That was really unusual, for the magnetic declination in this portion of Egg was nearly a quarter-pi off vertical.</p>
<p>&quot;Moving-Sand!&quot; he pounded into the crust.</p>
<p>From off on a distant corner of the compound came a gruff reply. &quot;About time you came back.&quot;</p>
<p>The ancient tracking senses built into the super-sensitive undertread of Cliff-Web instantly triangulated the position of the sound and placed Moving-Sand in the northeast corner of the potting compound. With his attention riveted on that portion of</p>
<p>the surrounding territory, his tread could now pick out the motion of someone else with Moving-Sand. He flowed across the outer courtyard to the opposite side of the large compound.</p>
<p>&quot;That is an amazing display of fountain plants,&quot; Cliff-Web said as he rounded the potting compound wall. &quot;One of those plants looks as if it has been growing for a half-dozen turns or more. How did you accomplish that? And how did you get the fountains to go straight up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She helped a little,&quot; said Moving-Sand, his eye-stubs twitching in the direction of the stranger. She was a large, slightly over-bulky female who was obviously well past her egg-bearing prime, but still not quite ready to quit and tend hatchlings. The normal motion of her eye-stubs switched to the converging wave greeting pattern as she spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Zero-Gauss, Doctor of Magnetics at the Institute,&quot; she said. &quot;I specialize in the study of the interaction of magnetic fields on plants.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then it is your compound that has the cleft-wort trained to climb the staircase of supports on the window.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied. &quot;When Moving-Sand came over to inquire about my technique, I learned that you had a large collection of strange plant forms. We have had such an interesting time while you were away. I've explained my various tricks in using magnetic fields to train plants and animals, and Moving-Sand has supplied me with a number of new types of plants that you collected in your various journeys around Egg. They are not only lovely additions to my garden, but some of them are proving valuable in my research at the Institute.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I noticed that you two have really improved the performance of the fountain plant in the front circle bed,&quot; Cliff-Web said. &quot;What did you do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I brought over a large superconducting coil with a persistent current in it, and we buried it in the crust below the root system. We tilted it so that the direction of the combined magnetic fields of the coil and Egg is vertical. That way, the jet of sparks from the fountain plant can rise straight up as it does at its home location at the East Pole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was a lot of work. But it did the trick,&quot; said Moving-Sand grudgingly. 'That fountain plant has lasted more than a dozen turns and is still growing. Best I could do before was three turns. Was hardly worth bothering to plant them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess even plants thrive best when conditions are similar to what they are familiar with,&quot; said Cliff-Web.</p>
<p>&quot;Not necessarily. In my research laboratory at the Institute,&quot; Zero-Gauss explained, &quot;I have found that many plants grow faster and healthier if there is no magnetic field at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No field at all?&quot; Cliff-Web's engineering curiosity was aroused. &quot;What do you do? Put them at the center of some Helmholtz coils and cancel out the magnetic field of Egg?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do use a pair of large Helmholtz coils to start with,&quot; she replied. &quot;The coils only zero out the field at the center, however. Even a few microns away the cancellation is poor enough that the plant is affected. Between the coils I have built a special room lined with superconducting shielding where I have completely eliminated the magnetic field of Egg over a large enough volume that I can carry out tests on dozens of plant samples at the same time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't understand.&quot; Cliff-Web's eye-stubs were twitching in a confused manner as his engineer's brain tried to imagine how one could make such a room. &quot;I suppose you could make a room with a floor and walls made out of high quality superconducting plate, but even if the walls were extremely tall, the fringing fields would come in over the top. That wouldn't work at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't mean a regular room, open to the sky,&quot; Zero-Gauss explained. &quot;My laboratory is under the crust and has a domed cover of superconducting plate over the top, like the 'ceilings' or 'roofs' the humans use on their living and working compounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You wouldn't catch me working in that place,&quot; Moving-Sand muttered. &quot;I don't trust things over top of me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The dome is artificially cooled to simulate the cold of the sky,&quot; said Zero-Gauss. &quot;That helps me a lot when I'm working in there. Since it is as dark as the sky, I can't see it, so it is easy to pretend it isn't there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That must be an amazing structure,&quot; said Cliff-Web. &quot;I presume there are pillars and double-arches holding up the domes like those in the human cathedrals. How big is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is thirty millimeters square and has a post every centimeter. The top of the dome is five millimeters up,&quot; she replied. &quot;Would you like to see it?&quot; She hesitated, then added, &quot;We limit direct access, since each entry allows a little more magnetic field to leak in. However, we have an array of remotely controlled video cameras that will let you look at any portion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to see it,&quot; Cliff-Web told her. He led the way back from the potting rooms through the gardens to the front door of the compound. Slurge was quietly trimming the lawn, and Rollo and the Slinks were gone. As he activated the compound door, the area was suddenly full of Slinks. Using his body to block the Slinks from getting out into the street, Cliff-Web escorted Zero-Gauss out the door, for the first time touching the large female.</p>
<p>Moving-Sand came up to chase the Slinks from the doorway and <em>'trummed</em> after them. &quot;You can't go now. You just got here. You haven't even read your message file. You must have six dozen messages to answer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll get to them later,&quot; Cliff-Web answered as he led the way down the slidewall toward the Inner Eye Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;One of them is from the Rejuvenation Selection Committee,&quot; hollered Moving-Sand. Cliff-Web paused, then continued on down the street, silently thinking.</p>
<p>Zero-Gauss got his attention with an electronic whisper that tickled his backside. &quot;I am impressed. The committee only started announcing the names of those that were being selected for the rejuvenation process a dozen turns ago. You must be up at the top of the list.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must be a long list,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I know of only one scientist at the Institute who is on it. Don't forget, the process is so time-consuming and costly that they are only able to undertake one rejuvenation every three turns—only four dozen cheela in a whole great of turns. It must be tough having to make the decision of who are to be the lucky few who are going to be allowed to live a second life while the rest of us will have to die when our time comes.&quot;</p>
<p>Cliff-Web was too embarrassed to reply, and they moved along the slidewalls in silence, switching leads at each tack. As they came to the next intersection they switched places again so that Cliff-Web was spreading the field lines again. Snuggled up to his trailing side, Zero-Gauss tried to break the silence with a whispered comment.</p>
<p>&quot;You certainly have an unusual personal robot,&quot; she said. &quot;It is one of the most lifelike robots I have ever seen. Yet most personal robots are programmed to be deferential and polite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Moving-Sand is one of our newest models. I'm checking it out before we go into production. As for his personality, being owner of a large company, I meet nothing but deferential and polite people. I wanted something different at home to keep my brain-knot from getting too big for my hide. I programmed Moving-Sand’s personality atter the Old One that raised me in the clan hatchery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good idea,&quot; said Zero-Gauss. &quot;Keeps you thinking like a hatchling. When I can afford a personal robot, I think I'll do the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anything to keep the egg-tending syndrome from starting,&quot; said Cliff-Web. &quot;Gardening helps, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That was one of the reasons I chose plants and small animals for my research,&quot; said Zero-Gauss. &quot;Of course, all that may be unnecessary now that we have rejuvenation.&quot;</p>
<p>The rest of their journey to the Inner Eye Institute was carried out in silence.</p>
