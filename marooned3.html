<p>Heavy-Egg finally came to his senses. He dimly remembered the shrieking pain in his eye-balls. It now was a dull ache. He stretched his eye-stubs to make sure his eyes weren't hidden behind their eyeflaps, but he could see nothing. He listened with his tread, trying to figure out where he was. All was silent around him. The only sounds were the thumping of his fluid pumps and faint rumbles from deep inside Egg.</p>
<p>Pieces of memory started to return. He remembered blindly wandering around on the top of the East Pole mountains, mad with pain. Finding the drop chute. Creeping, falling, sliding down through the darkness. New pain as he hit a broken section of the chute. Cries for help into the crust until his tread was raw, but no help came. Then the hunger pains grew stronger than the burn pains. He had finally found food. A chunk of food was in his manipulator, ready to go into his eating pouch. He was starved. But for some reason he had not eaten.</p>
<p>He felt something underneath his tread. It was the body of another cheela. He moved his tread around, feeling the dead body—it was a large female. There were long slashes in the body torn by a crude blade. The sharp piece of metal that had caused the slashes was in one of his manipulators. The chunk of food was in another. He formed a set of tendrils and reached out to touch the food. It was smooth and round and soft and leathery...</p>
<p>&quot;An egg!!!&quot; he cried, his tread grating the crust with its vibrations. &quot;I nearly ate an egg!!!&quot;</p>
<p>He went mad again.</p>
<p>Eye-stumps waving erratically, he put the egg back in its mother, then stumbled across the deserted street. He found a store with an open door. It was a pulp-bar. Pushing his way past the body of the barkeeper he found the cache of pulp-bags. He couldn't read them, but after sucking a few bags dry he didn't care. The dull pain in his eyes went away. He felt good. He loaded his carrying pouches with as many bags as he could carry and weaved his way back out into the street.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; he called. No answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Got to keep on moving. Got to find <em>somebody.&quot;</em></p>
<p>He moved his overloaded body laboriously down the street and found another open door. This one led to a repair shop. Maybe he could find a good knife. He found lots of tools, but no knife. He picked up a tool from its holder next to the mechanic's work-pad. It was a welding torch. It used tanks of liquids that were mixed to produce an ultra-hot flame. The torch was on automatic and it immediately formed a long flame that flickered toward Heavy-Egg's hide. He screamed in insane panic as he felt intense heat once again. His pouches vomited bags of distilled pulp, and he dropped the torch which licked at a bag that burst into a bright violet-white ball of flame.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see!!&quot; Heavy-Egg said as the singed end of one of his eye-stumps gave a weak response to the intense flood of light. Entranced by the light, he madly added bag after bag of pulp to the growing blaze. The equipment in the shop caught on fire and drove him out into the street. Then the tanks of welding liquid blew up in a tremendous explosion.</p>
<p>The next time Qui-Qui checked in on the communicator, there was some good news.</p>
<p>&quot;Staring-Sensor at the East Pole Space Station has detected a large fire and explosion in Swift's Climb at the base of the East Pole mountains,&quot; said Lieutenant Shannon-Capacity. &quot;It could be a signal or it could be a delayed reaction to the starquake. So far, it is the only sign of life on Egg.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then it is our only hope,&quot; said Qui-Qui. &quot;I'm heading for Swift's Camp. I'll take the flyer, but I'm not going to fly, it wastes too much power. I'm going to travel close to the surface where the gravity repulsors have plenty of mass to push against. In that mode I could travel around Egg a couple of times without emptying the accumulators.&quot; She paused, &quot;Sure seems like a terrible waste though. Here I have this terrific toy that can fly about in the sky and I have to use it as a dull crust-glider.&quot;</p>
<p>Leaving the robot tending its rejuvenation machine, Qui-Qui lifted the flyer on a low altitude, minimum energy flight profile, and headed for the East Pole. Meter after barren meter passed under the flyer as she traversed the glowing yellow-white crust.</p>
<p>Avoiding the wreckage of the Jump Loop spread over the crust, she brought the flyer down in a flat space in the outskirts of Swift's Climb. Finding nothing to tie it down to, she made sure that the machine was left far from anything solid in case there was another crustquake. Before leaving the flyer she made a call to the East Pole Space Station floating overhead and waited for the reply.</p>
<p>&quot;The blaze occurred in the eastern section,&quot; said Staring-Sensor. &quot;It's the old section of town right at the bottom of the superconducting chute that was used by the Web-Con workers on the Space Foundation project. Just find an east-west road and head for the mountains.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then another voice entered the communication link. It was Hohmann-Transfer.</p>
<p>&quot;At all costs you <em>must</em> protect our flyer,&quot; the admiral warned. &quot;The fire may have been caused by looters. You are to take weapons with you and report in every dothtum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no weapons, and it will take me two dothturns just to get to the east side from here,&quot; said Qui-Qui. &quot;Besides, one fire does not a band of looters make. I will report in when I get back.&quot;</p>
<p>Qui-Qui did begin to feel a little uneasy as she made her way through the deserted town. She moved quietly and stopped often to listen. Finally she heard a voice. It had the high tenor pitch of a male tread. The voice sounded drunk and off-key. As she moved along the streets, tracking down the voice, she recognized the tune. It was <em>her</em> song, &quot;Twine Thine Eyen About Mine.&quot;</p>
<p>She came to an intersection and looked down the street. Wandering blindly from slide-walk to slide-walk was a filthy, drunken, heavy-set male. Where his eye-balls should have been were oozing sores on the ends of stumps. Shreds of skin hung from his blistered hide. Shocked by his condition, Qui-Qui stood still in the middle of the intersection as he weaved his way closer. Her first reaction was that of revulsion. It changed to pity as she realized the pain and suffering he had gone through even to survive, while she flitted around in a luxurious flyer. He was coming to the third verse in the song, and she softly blended her deep contralto voice into his.</p>
<p>&quot;...Be my friend, by my lover, Be my tread, be my cover. Twine thine eyen about mine.&quot;</p>
<p>The male's voice trailed off as hers became louder.</p>
<p>&quot;I must <em>really</em> be going mad!&quot; he said out loud to himself, throwing the half-finished bag of cheap pulp juice into the street.</p>
<p>&quot;No. You're not,&quot; said Qui-Qui, moving toward him.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this the way you die?&quot; he said, still not sending his tread vibrations in her direction. &quot;All my life I have longed for Qui-Qui. Now I imagine she is here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I <em>am</em> here,&quot; said Qui-Qui in her unmistakable voice, &quot;I am <em>really</em> the Qui-Qui you have longed for and I have come to take care of you.&quot; She moved alongside Heavy-Egg, gently twined three eye-stubs about his wounded stumps and led him off to a hospital she had noticed a few blocks away. As they moved along side-by-side, she sang to him.</p>
<p>At the hospital she cleaned his hide, anointed his blisters, bandaged his eye-stumps, and filled his eating pouches with decent food. Then she made love to him.</p>
<p>She concentrated on the bulk of the body of the male and ignored the lack of eye-balls. His tread massaged her topside with quivering delight, while his twelve eye-stubs wound tighter and tighter around hers until they were coupled eyeflap to eyeflap. The orifice at the base of his eye-stubs opened and droplets of fluid from his body fell into her waiting eyeflaps. A long yearning in each of them was finally satisfied. Qui-Qui relaxed under Heavy-Egg's limp body as the droplets made their way through her body to her eager egg-case.</p>
