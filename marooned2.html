<p>The last place Qui-Qui checked was the Rejuvenation Center. As she expected, everyone was dead there, too, even the &quot;dragon plants,&quot; snapped off at their roots. The large rods of dragon crystal that had supported the plants now lay glistening on the crust. She moved past a motionless robotic body on her way out and stopped as she felt an electronic tingle.</p>
<p>&quot;Emergency! Emergency!&quot; a metallic voice whispered. She moved closer to the robot. The body of the robot didn't move, but the electronic tingle became stronger.</p>
<p>&quot;Emergency! Emergency!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The emergency is over,&quot; Qui-Qui's tread vibrated through the crust. The robot continued its alarm as if it hadn't heard her. She switched to whispering herself.</p>
<p>&quot;The emergency is over,&quot; Qui-Qui whispered, using her body to set up oscillations in the sea of electrons around them.</p>
<p>&quot;Emergency! Crustquake! Activate Plan Two! Call Doctor!&quot; said the robot.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; commanded Qui-Qui, who owned a dozen personal robots. &quot;Emergency Over! Restart! Report Condition!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Three-greths functional,&quot; said the robot. &quot;I must report to a medical doctor. A failure has occurred.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop! Restart! Emergency over! Tell me how to activate communications links to Bright's Heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must report to a medical doctor,&quot; said the robot. &quot;You are not a medical doctor.&quot; It fell silent.</p>
<p>Qui-Qui was puzzled. The robot's eyes were useless. How did it know she wasn't a medical doctor? She went back to the main offices, found the remains of M.D. Sabin-Salk, pulled off his ornate badges, and replaced her glow-jewel decorations with badges. She went back to the robot, but didn't get too close. She could have done a good imitation of M.D. Sabin-Salk's tread accent, but she had never heard him whisper. She did the best she could.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me how to repair the communication links to Bright's Heaven!&quot; she commanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Open box,&quot; said the robot.</p>
<p>Qui-Qui was bewildered. She looked around, then saw a large metal box in one corner of the room. The room wall had suffered a large dent where the box had slid into it. She went over to the box and read the badly faded label. It was another robot! According to the label, it was a maintenance robot for the next bank of enzyme machines that were due to be sent to the rejuvenation center. She undid the latches and slid off the heavy lid. Twelve glassy eyes raised up from a Slink-sized dome and looked around. The top of the dome had the design of a cleft-wort plant.</p>
<p>&quot;Energy!&quot; it said. The end of the box fell away and the robot glided out on its undulating underside. It paused by the damaged robot to exchange information, then moved into the enzyme machine room, where it found a partially full accumulator and reenergized itself. Qui-Qui followed it. The robot ignored her and started to lift an enzyme machine back onto its base.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; she said. &quot;Repair the communication links to Bright's Heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is not my function,&quot; said the robot. &quot;My function is to maintain the Rejuvenation Center in operational condition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reset!&quot; she commanded. 'The Rejuvenation Center cannot operate without doctors. All the doctors are dead. You must get new doctors. The doctors must be called from Bright's Heaven. You must repair the communication links to Bright's Heaven so the doctors can be called.&quot;</p>
<p>The robot paused in its repair of the damaged enzyme machine. It moved to the main offices, found one of the video link consoles, and opened it. It carried out a few tests, then moved to the next console. Since none of them were operational, it then took out a part from one console, other parts from another console, more from a third, and put them in a fourth. It left the room for a while and came back with a small energy source to power the console. It went through its testing routine again.</p>
<p>&quot;The communication link is repaired. Bright's Heaven does not respond.&quot; It returned to its work of fixing the enzyme machine.</p>
<p>Qui-Qui tried the video-link console. She had made so many long-distance calls in her life that she knew all the screen blotches and tread murmurs that indicated the condition of the various portions of the links. The call probably made it to the central exchange at White Rock City, but the fibers were dead from there to Bright's Heaven. She tried to get the robot to go to White Rock City to fix the central exchange, but it refused to leave its assigned duty station and the enzyme machines. She finally gave up and set out for White Rock City herself to pick up her flyer.</p>
<p>As soon as the flyer was activated, the acoustic coupler to the deck vibrated the floor with a recorded message.</p>
<p>&quot;Qui-Qui! Respond on channel 36. Qui-Qui! Respond...&quot;</p>
<p>The communications set was already on channel 36 so she activated the transmitter.</p>
<p>&quot;Qui-Qui here,&quot; she said. After two long grethturns there was an eager reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Lieutenant Shannon-Capacity here, Qui-Qui. Are you all right? I'm switching you right over to the admiral.&quot;</p>
<p>The harsh voice came rasping through the deck. The admiral sounded even more harassed than the first time.</p>
<p>&quot;Your behavior is inexcusable!&quot; said Admiral Hohmann-Transfer. &quot;From now on I want you to make contact every turnfeast and midturn. Do you understand? Where have you been?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was trying to find somebody else,&quot; said Qui-Qui. &quot;I was not successful. Were you?&quot; She then went through another long wait.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Hohmann-Transfer. &quot;What am I going to do? We are doomed!&quot; There was another long pause. &quot;If only we had someone else than a <em>stupid</em> entertainer.&quot;</p>
<p>The link to the admiral clicked off. Qui-Qui was about to turn off the power when she heard Shannon-Capacity again.</p>
<p>&quot;There is someone else who wants to talk to you,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;...Hello? ...is this Qui-Qui? ...&quot; came the voice. &quot;I...ah...I met you some time ago...didn't really <em>meet</em> you really...I saw you when you were going through the Rejuvenation Center...my name's Cliff-Web...run a construction company...or used to.&quot;</p>
<p>Qui-Qui had been through this before. Another male overflustered by her large eyeflaps.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember <em>you&quot;</em> she said in her best stage tread. &quot;The doctor said you needed to do some extra exercises. I didn't think so. You looked fine to me.&quot; After another long wait, Cliff-Web replied. He had regained his composure.</p>
<p>&quot;You looked fine to me, too,&quot; he said. &quot;And I bet you're looking even better now after rejuvenation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...I wish we had video,&quot; Shannon-Capacity interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been twenty turns since the starquake,&quot; Cliff-Web continued. &quot;And you're the only one we've been able to contact. I've talked to the few people here on the space station who know you and I've done some research in our library, limited as it is. You produce your own performances, manage your own finances, control dozens of personal staff including a dozen robots, and pilot you own flyer. You are <em>not</em> stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>He hesitated before continuing, &quot;Do you think you can become an engineer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; she replied. &quot;With the right teacher and enough time. Why?&quot; The answer from Cliff-Web came two grethturns later.</p>
<p>&quot;The admiral is basically right. We're stuck up here. We don't have any spacecraft that can land on Egg under its own power without crashing. We can't build a lander because we have no tools and no raw materials to work with. We need something to 'catch' one of the spacecraft we have. The jump loops are down, but it might be possible to reactivate one of the gravity catapults if they aren't too badly damaged.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My plan is to use the robots on Egg,&quot; Cliff-Web explained. &quot;With the two grethturn communications delay from synchronous orbit to the surface, it will be impossible for us to direct them from up here. But if you can help control them, we can send down the information needed for them to make repairs to the catapult. First, however, we have to find those robots and gather them at one of the poles. Can you do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've already found some,&quot; said Qui-Qui. &quot;They are just as dead as everyone else. Except for one. I found him in a box at the West Pole Rejuvenation Center. He works perfectly, except he only wants to work on keeping rejuvenation machinery fixed. I tried all the robot control tricks I could think of, but the best I could do was make him fix the video link machines. Unfortunately, it was the only functional robot I saw. I'm afraid we can't use robots to repair the gravity catapults.&quot; Although disguised by the squeaky sound caused by the gravitational time shift, Qui-Qui could hear the overtones of dejection when Cliff-Web's voice finally returned.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll have to think of something else,&quot; said Cliff-Web. &quot;Well, goodbye for now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goodbye, Engineer Cliff-Web,&quot; Qui-Qui said in her most pleasant tone. &quot;It has been a real pleasure talking to you. I hope to see you in person <em>real</em> soon.&quot;</p>
<p>She spent the next two grethturns thinking of the many greats of turns she faced being all alone.</p>
<p>When Qui-Qui's gravitationally red-shifted voice finally reached Cliff-Web, it had been lowered from her normal contralto range to a slow, husky tone normally only heard in the privacy of a love-pad room. Cliff-Web stammered a reply. &quot;...ah...Yes. I've really enjoyed...been a pleasure...talking with you...ah...Qui-Qui...really nice...&quot; The link went dead.</p>
<p>Two turns later Qui-Qui returned to the Rejuvenation Center wearing a full panoply of M.D. badges. The maintenance robot had repaired the auxiliary power generator and had gotten one enzyme machine working. Once that was done, it had allowed itself to work on lower priority items and had cleaned out all the bodies and tidied up the place. It was now trying to get a second enzyme machine working. She slipped into the main office and tried to read the files to find out how the Center worked so she could do a better job of playing a doctor. There was no power to the memory banks, so she went back and complained to the robot. It took him two turns, but he finally got the main office memory powered and running.</p>
<p>She then found that the memory files were blank. They had been erased by the radiation during the quake. She went into M.D. Sabin-Salk's old office compound and took down a few scrolls from his scroll wall. Except for some very faint markings at the very center of the scroll, they were blank too. She reported her findings to the West Pole Space Station.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you still at the West Pole?&quot; Hohmann-Transfer was annoyed. &quot;You should be out looking for robots or something useful!&quot; Her harassed voice changed to one of near panic as Shannon-Capacity told her the bad news. &quot;I could expect computer files to go, but scrolls, too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even taste-plates,&quot; said Qui-Qui. &quot;There used to be an ornate taste-plate sign in the crust at the entrance to the Center. It's now tasteless.&quot; The delayed reply back from Hohmann-Transfer was worse than useless.</p>
<p>&quot;Civilization is destroyed! What shall we do?!?&quot;</p>
<p>Qui-Qui didn't bother to reply. She turned off the communicator and returned to her battle of wits with the robot. First she got it to reconstruct most of the files for the operation of the rejuvenation center from its internal memory. She then read those and figured out a way to get the robot to recharge the accumulators on her flyer. She ordered it to bring the accumulators in from the flyer as &quot;urgent cargo&quot; and put them next to the accumulators that were used as standby power to the enzyme machines. She then sent it off on a &quot;repair&quot; in the main office while she switched cables and charged up the accumulators. Then she made the robot haul the &quot;urgent cargo&quot; back to the flyer. She was now ready to go anywhere on Egg. But there was nowhere to go.</p>
